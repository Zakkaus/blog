Hi, I’m **Zakk**—an Australia-based student writing in English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese about Gentoo tinkering, design experiments, finance workflows, and daily stories with Paper (my partner) plus our guinea pigs Hash Brown and Potato.

## What you’ll find here
- 🐧 **Linux & Gentoo notes** – practical walkthroughs such as the [Gentoo installation guide](/posts/gentoo-install/).
- 🧠 **Process and design** – documenting the systems I build to stay organised across study, remote life, and creative projects.
- 💬 **Relationship & bilingual life** – snapshots of long-distance routines, recorded in English and Chinese.
- 🐹 **Guinea pig chronicles** – because Potato and Hash Brown demand a stage.
