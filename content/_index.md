{{< lead >}}
Hi, I’m **Zakk**, an Australia-based business student who keeps bilingual notes about Gentoo, design experiments, finance routines, and the long-distance life I share with Paper.
{{< /lead >}}

### What I’m focused on right now
- Rebuilding my Gentoo setup and writing concise guides so friends can follow along without getting lost in wikis.
- Keeping finances tidy while balancing study, part-time work, and cozy downtime.
- Designing small, calm interfaces that feel like home screens I’d actually use.

### Paper & me
Paper lives in Taiwan; we’ve been together since **7 Aug 2025** and count the days on the [timeline](/timeline/#couple). We sync playlists, swap drawings, and plan the next Australia visit while she finishes high school.

### Potato & Hash Brown
Two Teddy guinea pigs running our apartment. Potato is a fearless foodie; Hash Brown sprints laps and squeaks “515151” for snacks. Their milestones live on the [timeline](/timeline/#pets).
