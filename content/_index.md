I’m **Zakk**, an Australia-based business student keeping a bilingual log of Linux tinkering, design experiments, tidy finance systems, and long-distance life with Paper plus our guinea pigs Hash Brown & Potato.

### Right now
- 📍 Living in Sydney (AEST/AEDT) while studying business and working on cloud-native labs.
- 🐹 Guinea pig roommates Hash Brown & Potato keep the house noisy, curious, and well-fed with bell peppers.
- 💌 Balancing time zones with Paper in Taiwan through daily check-ins, collaborative playlists, and weekend design jams.

### Build log & interests
- **Gentoo / Linux**: reproducible dotfiles, init system experiments, and scripts that make reinstalling fun.
- **Design systems**: accessible component libraries, typography pairing, and Hugging Face-powered UI prototypes.
- **Finance & ops**: zero-based budgeting, low-friction automations, and documentation habits that scale.
- **Community**: sharing bilingual notes so Paper and friends can follow every iteration.
