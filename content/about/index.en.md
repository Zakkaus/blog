I’m **Zakk**, living in Australia. My programming skills are modest, but I taught myself in junior high and have been able to build simple websites. I’m currently studying Business at university and took art classes in high school. My first ‘payday’ came from gaming during my first year. Although I’ve faced ongoing mental health challenges, I’m thriving in this new country and environment. Here, I write bilingual notes on Linux, experiments, travel, investing, and the fun daily life with Paper and our two Teddy guinea pigs, Hash Brown and Potato.

### Paper and Me
We met in Ceylan’s [Discord community](https://www.youtube.com/@xilanceylan) through casual chats that grew into daily companionship. Paper is finishing her final year of high school in Taiwan before coming to Australia for university, and we schedule visits every few months. You can follow her perspective on Instagram at [@abyss_74.50](https://www.instagram.com/abyss_74.50/) or check our live tracker on the [Timeline](/timeline/#couple).

{{< alert icon="heart" >}}
Paper and I began our 8,000 km long-distance relationship (Australia ↔ Taiwan) on **7 Aug 2025**. We’re both pansexual 🩷💛🩵, maintain our bond through playlists, caring check-ins, bedtime voice chats, and mutual support, and log each day on the [Timeline](/timeline/#couple).
