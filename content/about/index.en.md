I'm **Zakk**, currently living in Australia. My programming skills are quite basic, but I taught myself in junior high and can build simple websites. I'm now studying Business at university. I studied art in high school, and my first bucket of gold came from gaming during my first year of high school. I've been dealing with some ongoing mental health issues, but I'm very happy living in this new country and environment. Here, I write bilingual notes on Linux, experiments, travel, investing, and interesting daily life moments with Paper and our two Teddy guinea pigs, Hash Brown and Potato.

### Paper and Me
We met in [Ceylan's](https://www.youtube.com/@xilanceylan) Discord community, where casual chats turned into daily companionship. We plan to meet every few months. Paper is currently in her final year of high school in Taiwan and preparing to study at university in Australia. If you want to see her perspective, follow [@abyss_74.50](https://www.instagram.com/abyss_74.50/) on Instagram, or check our live counter on the [Timeline](/timeline/#couple).

Paper and I started our 8,000 km long-distance relationship (Australia ↔ Taiwan) on **7 Aug 2025**. We're both pansexual 🩷💛🩵. We maintain our rhythm through playlists, sharing and caring about each other's lives, bedtime voice chats, and mutual physical and mental support, logging every day on the [Timeline](/timeline/#couple).
