I’m **Zakk**, living in Australia. My programming skills are modest, but I taught myself in junior high and have been able to build simple websites. I’m currently studying Business at university and took art classes in high school. My first ‘payday’ came from gaming during my first year. Although I’ve faced ongoing mental health challenges, I’m thriving in this new country and environment. Here, I write bilingual notes on Linux, experiments, travel, investing, and the fun daily life with Paper and our two Teddy guinea pigs, Hash Brown and Potato.
