I‚Äôm **Zakk**, an Australia-based Business student writing bilingual notes on Linux tinkering, experiments, investments, and my long-distance life with Paper and our two Teddy guinea pigs, Hash Brown and Potato.

### Relationship with Paper
We met in the [Ceylan Discord](https://www.youtube.com/@xilanceylan) community, where casual chats became a daily ritual. Paper is finishing senior high in Taiwan before coming to Australia for university, and we plan visits every few months. Follow her perspective at [@abyss_74.50](https://www.instagram.com/abyss_74.50/) or see our live counter on the [Timeline](/timeline/#couple).
