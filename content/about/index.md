### Snapshot
- üìç Based in Sydney (AEST / AEDT) and studying Business.
- üß† Interests: Gentoo & Linux, ambient music, design systems, and tidy finance spreadsheets.
- üéÆ Comfort hobbies: long cozy gaming sessions, drawing, listening to Paper narrate daily adventures.
- üêπ Home life with two Teddy guinea pigs, Potato and Hash Brown.

### Relationship
We first met inside [Ceylan](https://www.youtube.com/@xilanceylan)‚Äôs Discord server. Casual chats became daily check-ins, then a partnership we both call a soulmate match. We plan trips every few months while Paper finishes senior high school in Taiwan and prepares to study in Australia. You can follow Paper at [@abyss_74.50](https://www.instagram.com/abyss_74.50/) and see how long we‚Äôve been together on the [Timeline](/timeline/#couple).
