## Quick Deployment

> Requirements: Node.js â‰¥ 18, `wrangler` CLI â‰¥ 3.0.

1. **Clone and enter the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zakkaus/cloudflare-stats-worker.git
   cd cloudflare-stats-worker
   ```

2. **Install Wrangler and log in**
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   wrangler login
   ```

3. **Create the KV namespace**
   ```bash
   wrangler kv namespace create PAGE_STATS
   wrangler kv namespace create PAGE_STATS --preview
   ```
   Then paste the IDs into `wrangler.toml`.

4. **(Optional) Enable D1 for trends and top pages**
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 create cloudflare-stats-top
   wrangler d1 execute cloudflare-stats-top --file=schema.sql --remote
   ```
   Uncomment the `d1_databases` section in `wrangler.toml` and set the generated IDs.

5. **Deploy ðŸŽ‰**
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

## Step 7: Access Your Analytics Dashboard

After deployment completes, visit your dashboard directly:

```
https://stats.example.com/
```

You'll see a beautiful analytics interface just like [stats.zakk.au](https://stats.zakk.au/) with:

- **Real-time metrics**: Today's PV/UV cards with instant updates
- **API health status**: Visual indicator showing system status
- **Trend charts**: Interactive graphs for 7/14/30-day periods
- **Top pages**: Ranked list of your most popular content
- **Theme toggle**: Switch between dark and light modes
- **Language selector**: English and Chinese interface options

The dashboard is completely standalone - no embedding needed, just share the URL!

## Free Tier and Upgrade Options

| Service | Free Allowance | When to Upgrade |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Workers** | 100k requests/day<br>10ms CPU time | Upgrade to **Workers Paid ($5/mo)** when daily traffic exceeds 100k or you need larger CPU headroom. |
| **KV** | 1 GB storage<br>100k reads/day<br>1k writes/day | Move to the paid bundle when you store large JSON payloads or retain long-tail history. |
| **D1** | 5M queries/month<br>1 GB storage | Switch to D1 Paid for heavier Top 10 usage or long-running trend queries. |

> **Note**: D1 is optional. If you only need real-time PV/UV counting, KV is sufficient and the dashboard still works (minus Top 10 and trends).

For most personal websites, the free tier is more than enough!

## API Endpoints

Once deployed, you can access these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://stats.example.com/health

# Page view count
curl "https://stats.example.com/api/count?url=/posts/example/"

# Overall statistics
curl https://stats.example.com/api/stats

# Daily trends
curl https://stats.example.com/api/daily
```
