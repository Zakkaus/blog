## Quick Deployment

> Requirements: Node.js â‰¥ 18, `wrangler` CLI â‰¥ 3.0.

1. **Clone and enter the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zakkaus/cloudflare-stats-worker.git
   cd cloudflare-stats-worker
   ```

2. **Install Wrangler and log in**
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   wrangler login
   ```

3. **Create the KV namespace**
   ```bash
   wrangler kv namespace create PAGE_STATS
   wrangler kv namespace create PAGE_STATS --preview
   ```
   Then paste the IDs into `wrangler.toml`.

4. **(Optional) Enable D1 for trends and top pages**
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 create cloudflare-stats-top
   wrangler d1 execute cloudflare-stats-top --file=schema.sql --remote
   ```
   Uncomment the `d1_databases` section in `wrangler.toml` and set the generated IDs.

5. **Deploy ðŸŽ‰**
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

## Step 7: Access Your Analytics Dashboard

After deployment completes, visit your dashboard directly:

```
https://stats.example.com/
```

You'll see a beautiful analytics interface just like [stats.zakk.au](https://stats.zakk.au/) with:

- **Real-time metrics**: Today's PV/UV cards with instant updates
- **API health status**: Visual indicator showing system status
- **Trend charts**: Interactive graphs for 7/14/30-day periods
- **Top pages**: Ranked list of your most popular content
- **Theme toggle**: Switch between dark and light modes
- **Language selector**: English and Chinese interface options

The dashboard is completely standalone - no embedding needed, just share the URL!

## Pricing: Free Tier vs Paid Plans

### Workers

| Plan | Price | Included Requests | CPU Time | Overage Pricing |
|------|-------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 100k requests/day | 10ms/request | N/A (hard limit) |
| **Paid** | **$5/month** | 10M requests/month | 50ms/request | $0.50 per additional 1M requests |

### KV (Key-Value Storage)

| Plan | Price | Reads | Writes/Deletes/Lists | Storage | Overage Pricing |
|------|-------|-------|---------------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 100k/day | 1k/day each | 1 GB | N/A (hard limit) |
| **Paid** | **Included in Workers Paid ($5/mo)** | 10M/month | 1M/month each | 1 GB | â€¢ Reads: $0.50 per 10M<br>â€¢ Writes: $5 per 1M<br>â€¢ Storage: $0.50 per GB/month |

### D1 (Serverless SQL Database)

| Plan | Price | Rows Read | Rows Written | Storage | Overage Pricing |
|------|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 5M rows/day | 100k rows/day | 500 MB | N/A (hard limit) |
| **Paid** | **$5/month** | 25B rows/month | 50M rows/month | 5 GB | â€¢ Reads: $0.001 per 1M rows<br>â€¢ Writes: $1 per 1M rows<br>â€¢ Storage: $0.75 per GB/month |

### Pay-As-You-Go Option

Even without subscribing to paid plans, you can **enable pay-as-you-go billing** to avoid hard limits:
- Workers: $0.50 per 1M requests beyond free tier
- KV: Individual operation pricing as listed above
- D1: Individual operation pricing as listed above

### Recommendation for This Project

- **Small personal blog (< 10k visitors/day)**: Free tier is perfect âœ…
- **Medium blog (10k-50k visitors/day)**: Workers Paid ($5/mo) recommended
- **High-traffic site (> 50k visitors/day)**: Workers Paid + pay-as-you-go for KV/D1

> **Note**: D1 is optional. If you only need real-time PV/UV counting, KV alone is sufficient and the dashboard still works (minus Top 10 trends).

Once deployed, you can access these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://stats.example.com/health

curl "https://stats.example.com/api/count?url=/posts/example/"
