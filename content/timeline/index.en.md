We met through [Ceylan](https://www.youtube.com/@xilanceylan)'s community, evolving from daily chats into mutual physical and mental support that keeps our rhythm going. We're both pansexual ðŸ©·ðŸ’›ðŸ©µ, sharing playlists, gaming together, caring about each other's lives, and cross-timezone bedtime voice calls. Follow Paper at [@abyss_74.50](https://www.instagram.com/abyss_74.50/) for her perspective.
